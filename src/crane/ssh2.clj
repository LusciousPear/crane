note for shell out that wildcards and such are not expanded by the shell-out/sh because it jstu uses runtime-exec.  In order to runn a shell to evaluate args before runing the programs, use sh as follows: http://www.coderanch.com/t/423573/Java-General/java/Passing-wilcard-Runtime-exec-command#1870031
