To build:

1. Download and install leiningen http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
2. $ lein deps
3. $ lein install

core libs for s3, ec2, ssh.

build upon the core is remote repl and cluster capabilities.

in a couple cases, we use an erlang convention of the ! syntax representing "reomote" (on another process) execution.
the first argument to ! in erlang is the pid, wheras in our api, it is an open ssh session or socket.
there is no ! operator or fn, we just use the ! suffix convention to communicate remote execution.

remote shell execution.
(sh! session "tar -xzf repl.tar.gz")

remote repl evaluation.
eval! 
(eval! socket (execute (workflow some-cascading-workflow)))

TODO: add examples for usages.


TODO:
the persistent shell session using jsch ChannelShell is shaky at best, although exec works fine.
eval! may be simpler if we could use LineNumberingPushbackReader see comment in remote_repl.clj
stuff to poll and pull info from hadoop tracker url into repl
